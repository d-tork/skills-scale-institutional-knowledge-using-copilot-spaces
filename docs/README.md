# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This README provides an overview and entry point for all project management process documentation used by the OctoAcme team.

## What is OctoAcme Project Management?

OctoAcme applies proven, scalable processes to deliver cross-functional product initiatives successfully. The team follows iterative, data-informed practices and clear roles to ensure effective project delivery, from idea to retrospective.

## Brief Overview

Our project management approach is built on five key pillars:

### Lifecycle & Core Workflow

OctoAcme follows a five-phase approach to project delivery:

1. **Initiation**: Document purpose, value, metrics, stakeholders, and go/no-go decisions
2. **Planning**: Break down work, identify risks and dependencies, create backlog, define "done"
3. **Execution**: Standups, work tracking on GitHub Projects, quality checks, escalation protocols
4. **Release**: Standard checklists, verification, and communication
5. **Retrospective**: Learnings, action items, and continuous improvement

### Roles & Accountability

Clear ownership and collaboration across key roles:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines long-term product vision, strategy, and measures success
- **Product Owner (PO)**: Manages product backlog, writes user stories, and ensures daily team clarity on requirements
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA Lead**: Oversees quality assurance, develops test plans, and coordinates testing activities
- **Release Manager**: Plans and manages deployment activities and release communications
- **UX Designer**: Ensures user experience throughout the lifecycle and provides design guidance
- **Business Analyst**: Bridges technical and business teams by eliciting and documenting requirements
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals

### Risk Management & Communication

Lifecycle risk management and consistent stakeholder updates ensure transparency and early issue identification:

- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
- Continuous risk register maintenance

### Quality & Release Standards

Every release follows standardized processes:

- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Deployment checklists
- Verification procedures
- Clear communication to stakeholders
- Post-release monitoring
